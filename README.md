# IU_NLP_REACT

The objective of REACT is to provide cybersecurity incident response teams directed and actionable analysis of emails submitted as potential phish messages by end users for analysis. The tooling will provide analysis of email header and body contents to extract features for NLP tasks that will help identify similar messages and assist in more easily identifying campaigns by threat actors.

Leveraging machine learning for email analysis and correlation provides a benefit to CSIRT teams by automating tasks typically done as one off threat hunting tasks carried out by individual members in laborious search and analyze sprints. Automating these hunts can provide valuable insights into massive corpas of messaging and discover latent connections. VirusTotal and HybridAnalysis provide some of this functionality but solely on individual data points (IP addresses, domain names, hashes) or behavior analysis of executable files. This functionality is provided as publicly available analysis, which doesnâ€™t allow organizations to do robust analysis with internal communication and it to remain solely internal. This tooling provides internal CSIRT teams to utilize some of the analysis/correlation techniques used in these commercial products in an entirely internal setting, while gathering valuable insights into threats targeting their organization.
